# supporting multiple question type 

So far we had a simple question type - a sentence and its translation 
We could change the direction where we know the meaning but we have to find how to write it in the language we are learning 
Which is only the same logic with some change


I thought we may want more types

Here are general ideas for question types:
1. explanation - composed text with decorations - we only register if we see it 
2. hearing -  recognize a words in a sentence 
3. reading - alphabet related - learn to read 
4. writing - simple limited writing exercise - guided 
5. composing a sentence - a few sentence part maybe 2 or 3 that you have to put in order 



I would lik to avoid being to close to duolingo and I want to try and have my own way 
I could think of new ideas - especially with the AI age that could help me have somewhat a different approach
