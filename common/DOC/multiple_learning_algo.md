# Supporting multiple learning algo and version in a single code base. 


Currently I am writing new code for each algorithm/corpus 

I have to implement the following 
- get_quiz
- save_results
- statistics 

It would be best if I have a single code bases and I could add pluggable code for implementing specific 
- algorithm
- versions of algo
- language specific 
- corpus specific

To do that it would be best to use the same structure for all



## Tasks 

- [v] write the code with the ability for plug 
- [v] add per language functionality - formatting 
- [v] different mode for different algos
