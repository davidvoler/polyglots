# Polyglots 

Polyglots is a system for authoring, and managing language learning data using ai

The has 3 main models 

1. Content manager - for creating, loading and generating content
2. Editor - for creating courses and lessons from existing content
3. Student - for learning   

### TASKS

## Step 1 

### content_server

- [v] api code routes and models  

### content ui 
- [] start adding functionality

### Content
- [v] import options 
- [v] start planning course - router/api 
- [] start planning auto generated course (with AI)
- [] create course/lesson Tables
- [] create course/lesson UI


### Content Raw - Existing data transfer
- [] implement break into elements for Spacy 
- [] implement break into elements without Spacy
- [] copy options from tatoeba and polyglot

### backup data 

- [] backup data to desktop



## Step 2 

Raw Content playground

## Content UI

Important elements should be working 
Elements that are less useful for now - show text requires more permissions 

## Content - Courses and lessons 



## Step 3 

Make a decision on functionality - in content and course
What features should be included in alpha 
Does editor need a separate server/ separate client 



## Step 4

Complete features for Alpha - Content and Editor


## Step 5 

Start working on student app
### Student 

#### Desgin 
New ui design as we have now implemented course and lessons 
#### Data 
What should the data look like - Are we going for the idea of a single record well defined data

## Step 6
This is a decision making stage 
User data 
Algorithms 
Cache 
Algorithm tunning  

## Step 7 

Implementing the decisions of step 6 
Now we have the data structure set - the server should be simple with minimal 



### Backend 
- [] plan the api model/routes 

### Big Data - collecting user activity 

### Cache implementation 


## Step 8 
Student implementation
User interaction - statistics 

## Step 9 
Prepare for Alpha

## Step 10 
Alpha


## Steps 11 - 20
Product
Sales 
Searching for users
